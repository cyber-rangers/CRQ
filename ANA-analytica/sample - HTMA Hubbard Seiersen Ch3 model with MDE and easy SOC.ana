The curve should be interpreted as the likelihood that the total losses due to events (y-axis) will be greater than some loss threshold (x-axis).

Variable Residual_Risk
Title: Residual Risk
Description: Inherent risk represents the risk that remains given the current set of events (e.g., attacks, failures, etc.) and set of control measures that have been implemented (which do not guarantee the event will be prevented). It is a function of the expected loss magnitude for each event and the likelihood that the event actually takes place given control measures. The curve should be interpreted as the likelihood that the total losses due to events (y-axis) will be greater than some loss threshold (x-axis). One expects the residual risk curve will have lower probabilities than the inherent risk curve over the same loss threshold set.
